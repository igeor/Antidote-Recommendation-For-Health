confirmed to have the virus had been to the conference.\n\nThe email enclosed a letter from PHE, a government body. It told delegates to take no action if they were well but to stay indoors, avoid contact with others and call the NHS helpline if they developed symptoms such as a fever or cough.\n\n\u201cWhile the degree of contact you may have had with the case at the summit is unlikely to have been significant, we are taking a precautionary approach and informing you,\u201d the letter said.\n\nThe bus conference listed about 250 delegates from the nationwide bus and transport industry, including several members of parliament and directors of national transport operators.\n\nThe catered event took place over one day and included demonstrations of electric buses and discussions on national bus policy. The QEII centre, which has a capacity of more than 2,500 people, hosted another conference, for asset managers, on the same day.\n\nCiting patient confidentiality, authorities declined to give any further information on the person who had coronavirus, including their other movements in the UK or whether they had travelled from abroad.\n\nBut officials indicated that the individual is among the [nine patients in England](https://archive.ph/o/rTZpR/https://www.ft.com/content/63a4eaaa-4dce-11ea-95a0-43d18ec715f5) who have already tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nThey pointed to a commitment by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, that any new cases in the UK would be publicly announced.\n\nPublic Health England is now attempting to trace the contacts of each of those confirmed to have been infected by the virus, by collecting detailed information on a person\u2019s movements before they were diagnosed.\n\nProfessor Whitty has previously said it is very unlikely that the virus can be passed on by someone who is not displaying symptoms, but authorities are monitoring the available information to determine whether this is a concern.\n\nA spokesperson for Transport Times said it was \u201cworking closely with Public Health England, following their advice closely, and have distributed a letter of guidance from PHE to all attendees\u201d.\n\nOn Monday the UK government declared the coronavirus outbreak \u201ca serious and imminent threat to public health\u201d.
