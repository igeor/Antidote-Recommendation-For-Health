That sounds horribly stressful and difficult, especially for older people as it sounds like they may be? </p>\n\n<p>The sole thing I can think of is that lactose intolerance is likely to be handled relatively well if they are quarantined in Japan, since Japanese food is not dairy-centric compared to Western diets. I absolutely think they should be assisted with returning home to Britain ASAP, but I wonder if it would be helpful to their stress levels if a fluent Japanese speaker could provide them with translations for some simple sentences? </p>\n\n<p>I\u2019d suggest: \u201cI have type [one/two] diabetes.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI need access to insulin.\u201d (If this is the case.)</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI need a dentist.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI only speak English.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>\u201cI am allergic to milk.\u201d </p>\n\n<p>If I were in that position, lack of language would be very frightening to me too. Even if there is (as I hope may be the case) an effort going on behind the scenes to get this sorted, anything to relieve stress in the short term and make them feel slightly more empowered would be a good idea.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_f48qpn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/f48qpn/should_we_repatriate_and_quarantine_the_uk/fhp0wc0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1581779694.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1581779694.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CoronavirusUK", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1, "_fetched": true}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2f3oes", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fhos4t0", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": {"_listing_use_sort": true, "name": "coastwalker", "_fetched": false}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fhorvul", "score": 0, "author_fullname": "t2_7icut", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "kiLL thEm aLL /s Yes of course we should take them back and quarantine them.", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "downs": 0, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fhos4t0", "is_submitter": false, "collapsed": false, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>kiLL thEm aLL /s Yes of course we should take them back and quarantine them.</p>\n</div>", "gildings": {}, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "link_id": "t3_f48qpn", "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/f48qpn/should_we_repatriate_and_quarantine_the_uk/fhos4t0/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1581771736.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1581771736.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CoronavirusUK", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 2, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 0, "_fetched": true}]}
