How can I say this? Math.\n\nCurrently we are calculating fatality rate as total deaths / total suspected cases * 100\n\nThis is stupid flawed maths. Total suspected cases includes all current active cases, we don\u2019t know if they will live or die. Can you not see the flaw in this?\n\nTo correctly calculate fatality rate, the equation is\ntotal fatality rate from 6 days ago  / (current recovery total  + fatality rate from 6 days ago) * 100\n\nThe 6 days ago is a fair deduction made to account for how it takes longer for a person to be considered recovered and reported as such, compared to someone who dies. To explain simply, in a hypothetical situation 2 people are infected at the same time and progress at equal levels of illness, however one of the people dies, they are immediately counted, the other person survives but it takes several more days before they are officially considered recovered. To calculate an accurate fatality rate the dataset must be within a restricted timeframe and deductions made to account for the delay in case recovery reporting.\n\nMeanwhile there are other factors to take into account that are disturbing the accuracy of fatality rates. For one, it is widely accepted that CCP are not making accurate reporting of situation; there are likely hundreds of thousands of undiagnosed cases, many fatalities which are not reported due to the forced containment and quarantine, they also have dubious ways of reporting fatalities in general (no co-morbidity etc ) .

For this reason, personally, I would be keen to get infected with the virus ASAP before the shit hits the fan in my country, ensuring I have first access to healthcare and have a safe passage to immunity . Sadly I have no means to do so. If you do, maybe consider it . \n\nTl;dr. Fatality rate is likely around 4% while healthcare is available.
