positive for coronavirus, according to a frontline clinician working to stem the outbreak in the city.\n\nIt is believed Public Health England told them to self-isolate following a healthcare meeting attended by the infected GP and dozens of other doctors.\n\nThe Argus became aware of the situation after patients at Charter Medical Centre in Hove were told only four of the practice\u2019s 12 doctors were working on Monday morning because the rest of the staff were off sick.\n\nThe head of the practice said she could not respond to The Argus\u2019s request for comment.\n\nLast week, two doctors \u2013 one at County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton, and another who worked at Worthing A&E, tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe GP who attended the meeting the week before last, a Clinical Commissioning Group summit at Hove Town Hall, is believed to be one of the two doctors.\n\nLast week, the council ordered a deep-clean of the room where the CCG meeting took place after learning the GP had been present.\n\nSpeaking anonymously, a clinician tasked with handling the outbreak of coronavirus in Brighton said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the risks he said had been taken in this latest round of self-isolation, and the way the information has been withheld from the public.\n\nHe said: \u201cThere are 30 doctors in isolation after coming into contact with a GP who tested positive for coronavirus at the CCG meeting. Public Health England told them to self-isolate. This is a risk. There would have been a day or two in between them coming into contact with the GP with coronavirus and being traced and told to self-isolate.\u201d\n\nPublic Health England has said all five people who had the virus in Brighton have now recovered and been discharged.\n\nThe Argus has learned a nurse who spoke to the paper about her harrowing experience of self-isolation, an eight-month-old baby who was suspected of having coronavirus in Worthing, and a University of Sussex student taken to hospital by ambulance on Monday have all tested negative for the virus.\n\nA spokesman for Brighton and Hove CCG said there have been no new cases in the city for more than a week. He said: \u201cAll doctors and other primary care health workers in Brighton and Hove who were advised to \u201cself isolate\u201d as a precaution are expected to be returning to work this week.\u201d\n\nBut the clinician said: \u201cI\u2019m just shocked at that statement. I can\u2019t believe they are being allowed to go to be back at work so soon. Is their coming out of self-isolation based on not showing symptoms, or tests? Because as far as I know, I can\u2019t confirm they\u2019re even on a list to be tested. If we don\u2019t test every one of these healthcare workers, we\u2019re going to really struggle.\n\n\u201cWe need the confidence that tests have been done. Not showing symptoms in not empirical evidence that they do not have the virus.\n\n\u201cWe need to make sure local representatives of the CCG are not misleading us with false reassurance. The CCG seems more concerned about spinning the positives than telling people the truth.\u201d\n\nThe Argus approached the CCG and Public Health England, but neither would confirm how many doctors are in self-isolation, and PHE did not respond to our request for comment.\n\nThe clinician said: \u201cSince we last spoke, the authorities have kept a much tighter grip on this kind of information. It\u2019s all being controlled by Public Health England\u2019s microbiology department and NHS 111.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re keeping a tight reign on information, not even letting frontline staff know. If this is the way they\u2019re planning on dealing with it, we\u2019re just going to have to work within these limits and do whatever we can to stop the spread of the virus.\n\n\u201cThe more the public are informed the more they are armed, and the more we can defend ourselves.\u201d", "edited": false, "top_awarded_type": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "name": "t1_fi08i73", "is_submitter": false, "downs": 0, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_patreon_flair": false, "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>THIRTY doctors are in isolation after coming into contact with a GP who tested positive for coronavirus, according to a frontline clinician working to stem the outbreak in the city.</p>\n\n<p>It is believed Public Health England told them to self-isolate following a healthcare meeting attended by the infected GP and dozens of other doctors.</p>\n\n<p>The Argus became aware of the situation after patients at Charter Medical Centre in Hove were told only four of the practice\u2019s 12 doctors were working on Monday morning because the rest of the staff were off sick.</p>\n\n<p>The head of the practice said she could not respond to The Argus\u2019s request for comment.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, two doctors \u2013 one at County Oak Medical Centre in Brighton, and another who worked at Worthing A&amp;E, tested positive for the virus.</p>\n\n<p>The GP who attended the meeting the week before last, a Clinical Commissioning Group summit at Hove Town Hall, is believed to be one of the two doctors.</p>\n\n<p>Last week, the council ordered a deep-clean of the room where the CCG meeting took place after learning the GP had been present.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking anonymously, a clinician tasked with handling the outbreak of coronavirus in Brighton said he was \u201cshocked\u201d by the risks he said had been taken in this latest round of self-isolation, and the way the information has been withheld from the public.</p>\n\n<p>He said: \u201cThere are 30 doctors in isolation after coming into contact with a GP who tested positive for coronavirus at the CCG meeting.
