Medical supplies donated to the Red Cross Society of China\u2019s Wuhan branch sit unused in warehouses. Officials in Xiantao, a city 70 miles from Wuhan and one of the world\u2019s biggest manufacturing centers for protective supplies, ordered factories there to cease operations. Individuals who try to organize relief supplies face violating the country\u2019s strict charity law.\n\nBeijing has shown the world that it can shut down entire cities, build a hospital in 10 days and keep 1.4 billion people at home for weeks. But it has also shown a glaring weakness that imperils lives and threatens efforts to contain the outbreak: It is unable to work with its own people.\nThe coronavirus outbreak has exposed the jarring absence in China of a vibrant civil society \u2014 the civic associations like business groups, nonprofit organizations, charities and churches that bring people together without involving the government.\nBATTLING THE OUTBREAKRead the latest on the coronavirus.\nThink of it as the nervous system that helps a society move smoothly and briskly \u2014 something Benjamin Franklin recognized over 200 years ago when he organized Philadelphia\u2019s first volunteer fire department, first public library and first charity hospital. \u201cIt is prodigious the quantity of good that may be done by one man, if he will make a business of it,\u201d he wrote in 1783.\n\n\u201cThe traditional management mechanism of \u2018big government\u2019 is no longer efficient, and is even failing,\u201d Duan Zhanjiang, a management consultant, wrote in an article about managing the epidemic. \u201cThe government is very busy but not effective. The social forces aren\u2019t being utilized because they can only stand on the sideline, watching anxiously.\u201d\n\nMr. Duan suggested the government restrain its urge to be in charge of everything and focus more on supervision.\n\nThe Communist Party has never liked or trusted civil society. It is suspicious of any organization that could potentially pose challenge to its rule, including big private enterprises. It has cracked down on nongovernment organizations like rights groups and charities as well as churches and mosques. The party wants nothing to stand between its government and China\u2019s 1.4 billion people.\n\nBig Chinese corporations and wealthy individuals have been donating, many generously. But they also try to keep low profiles for fear of offending a government that is eager to take credit for any success and quick to suspect outside groups of challenging it.\n\n\nThose gaps are evident on the front lines of the outbreak, where workers have lacked the proper equipment to keep themselves safe. Doctors and nurses wear disposable raincoats instead of protective gowns. They wear ordinary, and inadequate, surgical masks while conducting dangerous throat swab tests. They wear adult diapers because, once they take off their one-piece protective suits, the suits will have to be thrown away. They only get one per day.\n\nAuthorities said on Monday that over 3,000 medical workers have been infected, though not all got it from work.\n\nOrdinary Chinese people have set up social media groups to help patients find hospital beds, get volunteers to drive them to hospitals and scavenge the world for protective gear. In coordination with the government, they could do much more.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just a small boat with very limited capacity,\u201d said Panda Yin, a Beijing-based designer who organized a WeChat volunteer group of about 200 people to help find protective supplies for front line medical workers. \u201cPeople came to us because they know the highway that\u2019s supposed to move fast has a big black hole on it.\u201d\n\nThat \u201cbig black hole\u201d is the Red Cross Society of China. Unaffiliated with the Red Cross elsewhere, the Red Cross Society is one of two government-controlled organizations through which Beijing monopolizes philanthropy. The Wuhan government has insisted that all donations go through the local chapter.\n\nThe Red Cross Society is notorious for corruption and inefficiency. The Chinese media have reported on many of its scandals, including one nine years ago when a person who reportedly held a senior position there shared pictures of her opulent lifestyle online.\n\n\nThe Red Cross Society has been slow in giving away masks and other supplies, according to analyses by people in China based on incomplete data. Buttressing those claims, the central government on Friday told it to speed up donations.\n\nWhen the society did give out masks, it gave the best and the most directly to local government agencies instead of to front line hospitals, according to its own data.\n\nOn Feb. 11, the Wuhan government\u2019s epidemic-fighting central command, which counts top city officials among its members, received nearly 19,000 N95 medical masks, considered among the most effective in filtering particles. Union Hospital, one of Wuhan\u2019s biggest public hospitals, received only 450. It was one of only four hospitals that received masks. On Feb. 13, all N95 masks went to local heath commissions. None went to hospitals.\n\nThree Red Cross officials in Hubei were disciplined earlier this month. The Red Cross in Wuhan said this week that it was only one part of the city\u2019s resource supplying team and that city officials were in charge of allocating supplies.\n\nIf the Red Cross Society is a bottleneck in distributing medical supplies, the local and central governments can sometimes become obstacles in private efforts to make, purchase and distribute these supplies.\n\nIn Xiantao, the city government on Feb. 3 shut down all but 10 of its protective-gear factories.\n\nA local official told the official People\u2019s Daily newspaper last week that the city made the decision for quality control reasons. Out of 113 sizable companies in the city, the official said, only two have the certificates to sell medical protective gowns in China because the majority of Xiantao\u2019s nonwoven fabric products are for exports only.\nNonsense, said a factory owner in Xiantao who asked to be identified only by his surname, Wang, for fear of retribution. The protective suits he makes for his British and American clients have to meet equal, if not higher, standards than those of China. Many get sold back to China anyway, he said. Xiantao officials did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe real reason is that Xiantao officials do not want to be held responsible if factory workers get infected or if quality problems emerge, said Mr. Wang and two other factory owners who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, a contention backed by local media reports in China. They agreed that in this extraordinary time the government should set prices and scrutinize quality closely. But it can set rules and supervise them, said Mr. Wang and others, instead of shutting them down.\n\nThe city allowed 73 more companies back to work by Feb. 9, the local official told the People\u2019s Daily, after getting approval from the provincial government, giving it political cover in case anything goes wrong. But the majority of the factories remain idle, said Mr. Wang and others.\n\nXiantao also cut off private efforts to secure supplies.\n\nEarlier this month, Xiantao city officials blocked volunteers from Jingzhou, a city in Hubei 100 miles to the west, from getting the supplies it needs. The Xiantao authorities tried to confiscate their gear at a checkpoint as they were leaving, according to one volunteer, and they were kicked out of the city. The volunteer asked to be identified by the surname Zhang because he is a government employee and is not authorized to speak to the news media.\n\nMr. Zhang said he and other volunteers had to step in because the Jingzhou health commission was overwhelmed and too bureaucratic to move fast enough to provide supplies to local hospitals.\n\nPhotos and videos he shared on social media showed volunteers delivered protective clothing, goggles and medical alcohol to hospitals. He almost cried, he told a chat group, when he saw doctors and nurses at a local fever clinic had nothing for protection except ordinary surgical masks. The head of the clinic was so grateful, he said, that she gave him four watermelons.\nVolunteers like Mr. Zhang raise money for supplies through social media. One of his chat groups is made up mostly of entrepreneurs like Mr. Liu, a tech entrepreneur in his 50s who only wants his surname used for fear of retribution.\n\nOne of the topics the group has debated is whether they can post their fund-raising statements on WeChat Moments, a social media feature similar to Facebook\u2019s time line. China has strict rules regulating individuals raising money from the public.\n\nThe business owners in Mr. Liu\u2019s group have experience dealing with the government. Some of them are wary of stepping on the toes of the public health authorities, who can come after them for any potential violation of public fund-raising rules.\n\nIf they have to stay clear of a very murky line, Mr. Liu argued, they probably won\u2019t be able to do anything.\n\n\u201cHuman lives should come above everything else,\u201d he said.\n\n\nLi Yuan writes the New New World column, which focuses on the intersection of technology, business and politics in China and across Asia. @liyuan6\n\n[In Coronavirus Fight, China Sidelines an Ally: Its Own People](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/business/china-coronavirus-charity-supplies.html)", "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "clicked": false, "title": "In Coronavirus Fight, China Sidelines an Ally: Its Own People -NY Times-02/18/2020", "link_flair_richtext": [], "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/Coronavirus", "hidden": false, "pwls": 6, "link_flair_css_class": "", "downs": 0, "thumbnail_height": null, "top_awarded_type": null, "parent_whitelist_status": "all_ads", "hide_score": false, "name": "t3_f5whxa", "quarantine": false, "link_flair_text_color": "dark", "upvote_ratio": 0.84, "author_flair_background_color": "#0266b3", "subreddit_type": "public", "ups": 26, "total_awards_received": 0, "media_embed": {}, "thumbnail_width": null, "author_flair_template_id": "24769a0e-5574-11ec-b310-9e1ed90b5602", "is_original_content": false, "author_fullname": "t2_3nelaphm", "secure_media": null, "is_reddit_media_domain": false, "is_meta": false, "category": null, "secure_media_embed": {}, "link_flair_text": "General", "can_mod_post": false, "score": 26, "approved_by": null, "is_created_from_ads_ui": false, "author_premium": false, "thumbnail": "self", "edited": false, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "gildings": {}, "post_hint": "self", "content_categories": null, "is_self": true, "mod_note": null, "created": 1582051396.0, "link_flair_type": "text", "wls": 6, "removed_by_category": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "domain": "self.Coronavirus", "allow_live_comments": false, "selftext_html": "<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=\"md\"><p>In Coronavirus Fight, China Sidelines an Ally: Its Own People</p>\n\n<p>The outbreak has exposed the powerlessness of private charities, civic groups and others who could help the effort but who the Communist Party considers rivals.</p>\n\n<p>Feb. 18, 2020, 9:00 a.m. ET</p>\n\n<p>17\nHospitals in Wuhan and surrounding Hubei Province have been making urgent pleas to the Chinese people for three weeks as the new coronavirus ripples through the country: Send more protective gear.</p>\n\n<p>Supplies are close \u2014 and yet frustratingly out of reach.
