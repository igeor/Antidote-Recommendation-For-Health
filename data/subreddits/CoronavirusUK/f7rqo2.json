Does it go off? I hopefully won&#39;t be needing it for 20 years or so. Seriously we have managed to think of emancipating race and gender but are still horribly cruel to the old IMHO. It is a worry to me, and I know I can do nothing to help any of my older relatives should they fail to die of a heart attack. There are some laws that you just do not break.</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "distinguished": null, "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "gildings": {}, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/f7rqo2/will_coronavirus_force_a_long_overdue/fiebtjr/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1582377310.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "link_id": "t3_f7rqo2", "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CoronavirusUK", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 0, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 1, "_fetched": true}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2f3oes", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "author_flair_template_id": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fift1d7", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": {"_listing_use_sort": true, "name": "HotPinkLollyWimple", "_fetched": false}, "can_mod_post": false, "created_utc": 1582392957.0, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fifhq3l", "score": 3, "author_fullname": "t2_36lim3ip", "removal_reason": null, "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "The relative of whom I wrote had dementia.
