After just 6 days of posting I was added to the China_Flu mod team with limited permissions and after 10 days I was on the Coronavirus mod team. After 20 days I was invited to join the exclusive senior mod Discord channel where we coordinated high level subreddit activities and CLO_Junkie would talk about other mods behind their back.\n\nNow back to the topic at hand.\n\nAs CLO_Junkie once said, [\"Mind the human.\"](http://archive.is/iOiAH)\n\nWith that in mind let's take a closer look at CLO_Junkie as a human and not just the \"CCP shill mod\" they're accused of being:\n\n[Here's a video](https://youtu.be/Vd8j8Vr0ZzM) of CLO_Junkie that they [posted to reddit ~19 days ago.](https://np.reddit.com/r/China_Flu/comments/ex7bgp/meta_reddit_as_a_p2p_health_information_exchange/) | [Archive](http://archive.is/MCg2P)\n\n[CLO_Junkie can be seen on the right](https://i.imgur.com/7tzT5Gl.png) discussing 'Reddit as a p2p health information exchange forum' with another reddit mod.\n\nCLO_Junkie would regularly lie to users without any issue. As Relik explains here, [CLO_Junkie lied about how they \"rarely ban people\" themself.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bannedfromcoronavirus/comments/f5hi2u/coronavirus_and_china_flu_mod_logs/fhz3irp/) The truth was that CLO_Junkie would mass ban users they disagreed with and [then go brag about it on Discord.](https://i.imgur.com/bD0jt8Q.png)\n\n[Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/KDMMTCd.png) of the time CLO_Junkie joked about quarantining fellow mod DeadlyKitt, who is one of the nicest people I've come accross on reddit.\n\n[Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/DGz10jr.png) of the time CLO_Junkie was abusive towards another mod Kimmey12. CLO_Junkie would remove mod permissions if anyone they disagreed with stepped out of line. [Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/tZ5iYyf.png) of CLO_Junkie in the senior mod discord saying Kimmey has been a PITA since they joined. Sorry Kimmey.\n\n[Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/TkbNyCq.png) of CLO_Junkie describing their hunt for the leaker with -Ph03niX-.\n\n[Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/d8QH6nF.png) of CLO_Junkie being a hypocrite and telling other mods not to post memes on China_Flu and then posting a meme themself under their alt account 'DesertAlt'.\n\n[Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/I0d7zBJ.png) of CLO_Junkie talking about using feedback threads as a way to attract dissenters and perma ban them since [\"there is no place for them here. Ideally, ban them in both subreddits.\"](https://i.imgur.com/vwPKh2n.png)\n\n[Here's a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/p9WD4S7.png) of CLO_Junkie getting frustrated that they can't double ban users from both Coronavirus and China_Flu for a rule violation in one subreddit.

Instead of just taking the time to reflect on why the logs were leaked they simply wanted to silence all opposition on the mod team the same way they've done on reddit. Even when CLO_Junkie was starting to consider the idea of public mod logs they decided to bring -Ph03niX- on board. Since -Ph03niX- is a terrible person and a power mod of hundreds of subreddits, including TopMindsOfReddit and AgainstHateSubreddits, [they persuaded CLO_Junkie to not release the logs and continue the censorship without user oversight.](https://i.imgur.com/ceoVukQ.png)\n\nFinally I'll finish by saying I'm not exempt from any blame.
