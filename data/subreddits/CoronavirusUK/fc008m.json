Well, tbf his risk will be reduced alot if he&#39;s not in the classroom but I understand that probably doesnt do much to dampen your worries.</p>\n\n<p>Im a teacher, I would say from my experience the highest risks he has is toilets (especially if theres no staff toilets which has been the case in a couple of places Ive worked) or if hes asked to rearrange rooms (ie touching alot of tables) - Which usually only happens en masse when theres exams, perhaps mocks which in most places Ive worked are held around Easter.</p>\n\n<p>Is he in a union? Wouldnt be surprised if some cleaners at the very least have raised worries to their reps which most likely are Unison. That&#39;s a way to put extra pressure on management to take it more seriously or be more vigilant.  </p>\n\n<p>EDIT: That&#39;s just my say from a teachers perspective, your husband of course will know the areas of risk greater than me.</p>\n</div>", "removal_reason": null, "collapsed_reason": null, "link_id": "t3_fc008m", "associated_award": null, "stickied": false, "author_premium": false, "can_gild": true, "top_awarded_type": null, "unrepliable_reason": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "score_hidden": false, "permalink": "/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fc008m/should_i_insist_that_i_work_from_home/fj9j2mc/", "subreddit_type": "public", "locked": false, "report_reasons": null, "created": 1583150382.0, "author_flair_text": null, "treatment_tags": [], "created_utc": 1583150382.0, "subreddit_name_prefixed": "r/CoronavirusUK", "controversiality": 0, "depth": 5, "author_flair_background_color": null, "collapsed_because_crowd_control": null, "mod_reports": [], "num_reports": null, "ups": 2, "_fetched": true}, {"subreddit_id": "t5_2f3oes", "approved_at_utc": null, "author_is_blocked": false, "comment_type": null, "awarders": [], "mod_reason_by": null, "banned_by": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "total_awards_received": 0, "author_flair_template_id": null, "distinguished": null, "likes": null, "user_reports": [], "saved": false, "id": "fj9l9bk", "banned_at_utc": null, "mod_reason_title": null, "gilded": 0, "archived": true, "collapsed_reason_code": null, "no_follow": true, "author": {"_listing_use_sort": true, "name": "d1ndeed", "_fetched": false}, "can_mod_post": false, "send_replies": true, "parent_id": "t1_fj9jszs", "score": 2, "author_fullname": "t2_4tgloc15", "approved_by": null, "mod_note": null, "all_awardings": [], "body": "Well from what Ive read you certainly should feel reassured by your age.
