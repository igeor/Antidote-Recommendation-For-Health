Prior to this organisations known as Friendly Societies offered some protection to members, who paid a fee, but the Act ensured workers could take sick leave and be paid 10 shillings a week for the first 13 weeks, and 5 shillings a week for the next 13 weeks. This Act was opposed by the Tories and was heavily voted against, but still managed to pass.\n\nThe National Government in the 1930s introduced the Holidays With Pay Act, as a result of a 20 year campaign of strikes. We'd generally refer to a National Government as a Coalition now, as it contained Tories, Labour and Liberal MPs. You'll note that the Holidays with Pay Act then would be amended to contain sick pay; for example The Holidays With Pay Order 1973:\n\n>Any worker, other than a casual worker, who becomes ill sick leave with pay. during the first twelve months of his employment shall, if he has worked for his employer on not less than 110 days be entitled to be granted, during those twelve months, sick leave with pay of a duration of 1 day for every 22 days on which he so worked. \n\n>Any worker, other than a casual worker, who becomes ill after the first twelve months of his employment shall be entitled to be granted, in each period of twelve months after the first, sick leave with pay of a duration of 2 normal working weeks. \n\nSick pay at this point was a function of the welfare state, and separate to occupational sick pay schemes that were generally fought for by unions.\n\nThatcher's Government introduced the Statutory Sick Pay (General) Regulations 1982, which introduced our current system of Statutory Sick Pay and abolished the Contributory Sickness Benefit paid by the then Department of Health and Social Security. To start with employers could reclaim all SSP, and the purpose of SSP was to offload some of the administrative burden, and also avoid a situation where an employee might have a contractual sick pay and also receive sickness benefit from the state.\n\n[Statutory Sick Pay was up to \u00a346.75 in 1987](https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1986/jan/15/statutory-sick-pay), which is equivalent to about \u00a3133/week in today's money (compare to \u00a394/week now). Back then, there were different levels of SSP based on your weekly earnings.\n\nJohn Major's government got rid of the right to reclaim SSP from the government, after initially dropping it from 100% to 80%; this gradually became a tax offset scheme. In 2014 the Coalition Government removed the ability of employers to offset SSP against their taxes, and so forced them to pay out of pocket. \n\nThere's points that can also be made as a result of the Tory party's historic opposition to unions, which preserved the rights of workers, and the proliferation of zero hours contracts since 2009. Zero hours workers are techincally entitled to SSP if they're over the earning threshold but it's very complicated to calculate, and in practice a lot of dodgy employers can get out of paying SSP to them (which they're even more encouraged to do now they can't claim the money back or offset against taxes). It's also worth noting the decreases in labour protections - the threshold for unfair dismissal was raised from one to two years continuous employment in 2012.\n\nThen there's the point about Universal Credit.
