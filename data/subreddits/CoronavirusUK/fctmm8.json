This is interesting thought, you would like to think they would be applying the scientific method while testing and there would be a standard across the world that the WHO e.c.t. would be using however I know this is not the case.

This must make it really difficult to get accurate figures from other countries, that's not even taking into account the difficulties in getting tests results from patients within the UK. I also believe there are problems with testing. Some tests are really accurate when the patient is symptomatic but not very accurate if they are asymptomatic.  I think alot of the scientific testing has been completed in China and they know that 14 days after a confirmed case people are likely to be clear e.c.t. \n2. I am not educated enough to say for certain on this but i imagine they will be gathering as much information as they can right now. we have not had alot of information from people who have been through the process, so what the doctors are asking them, if they have to go back for additional testing e.c.t. I cannot imagine they are not tracking the users and taking additional tests. but I don't really have any clue.  just another point on this one , once this start to spread it is not feasible to do that kind of tracking so i guess they will just pick a percentage or a number of users to follow to gain that data. There will be some scientist out there relishing the opportunity to do the research on this. \n3. I think this will be done on the stats/numbers. By now they are going to have a rough idea about the virus life cycle works, I think the idea is to have 14 day isolation that will probably be more than enough for 90% of people. I Guess they must accept that some people must still be infectious outside of that. I think in the phase we are in now, they are going to be able to monitor that, later on it will be impossible. \n4. I am not sure they are going to close schools e.c.t On face value that would seem like a good idea but, again children need to be looked after, that means people not working, and then how long can you maintain that? do you keep your children in for 2, 6, 8 weeks? what about Parents who are also doctors, nurses firefighters, police officers. Also this is much more dangerous to the elderly. so there is an argument that states, closing schools might stop the spread for a very short period but only in the General population and who not increase or decrease it for the elderly or the infirm. Again its so difficult with this but I guess that is the thought process the government is going through. \n5. God Knows! I think this is a bigger problem that people think. \n6.

I understand that at the moment, if you are self isolating, you can tell Tesco who will bag up your order in carrier bags and leave it at your door, that clearly cannot be the same for everyone. I know that in China they allowed people to the shops once every couple of days or something, it could be the same here, if you can get a Tesco delivery do that , otherwise only go if you have to e.c.t. only go out on your own or something.\n8.
