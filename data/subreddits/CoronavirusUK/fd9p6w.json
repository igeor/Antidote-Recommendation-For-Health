It's office work can be done via virtual means from home.\n\nBureaucracy. A company like Deloitte has a large corporate structure with a risk management team; they almost certainly have a specific policy on containment of infectious disease. This policy will feed off official Government advice.\n\n[The current Government advice to Employers and Businesses if there's a confirmed case of Coronavirus in an employee is:](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/guidance-to-employers-and-businesses-about-covid-19/guidance-for-employers-and-businesses-on-covid-19)\n\n>Closure of the workplace is not recommended.\n\n>The management team of the office or workplace will be contacted by the PHE local Health Protection Team to discuss the case, identify people who have been in contact with them and advise on any actions or precautions that should be taken.\n\n>A risk assessment of each setting will be undertaken by the Health Protection Team with the lead responsible person. Advice on the management of staff and members of the public will be based on this assessment.\n\n>The Health Protection Team will also be in contact with the case directly to advise on isolation and identifying other contacts and will be in touch with any contacts of the case to provide them with appropriate advice.\n\n>Advice on cleaning of communal areas such as offices or toilets will be given by the Health Protection Team. and is outlined later in this document.\n\nSo they're not recommended to close the office, and Public Health England are unlikely to recommend anything beyond isolating their immediate colleagues and deep cleaning the office (because we're in the Government's \"contain\" phase, not \"delay\" phase).\n\nThis is probably in part because the World Health Organisation has yet to declare coronavirus a pandemic.\n\nSo even if some of the office management team are like \"We should shut the office and do home working\", the large corporate structure will say \"we can only do that if official advice says we should\".
