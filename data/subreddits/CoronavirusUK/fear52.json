I've noticed that a lot of uni students have [questions and concerns](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fe0677/can_you_please_sign_this_petition_as_students_it/) about university closures, exams, etc. Also, I've been shocked by [how badly some universities have communicated](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fe0a4a/petitition_around_cluster_at_kings_college_london/) with their staff and students. Here, I'll share what I know from the staff side of things (though things at your uni may differ) - I don't think hiding information from students is helpful.\n\n* **Outright closures:** It is unlikely that your university will close outright without being told to do so by the government, but, by all means write to your university management questioning this if you feel concerned. You may also ask your lecturers to sign your letter, if you are a group of students. There are two online petitions I am aware of now, [one UK-wide](https://www.reddit.com/r/CoronavirusUK/comments/fe0677/can_you_please_sign_this_petition_as_students_it/) and one at [King's College London](https://www.change.org/p/senior-officers-at-king-s-college-london-king-s-college-london-community-has-coronavirus-and-needs-to-stop-classes).\n* **Lectures:** Some people are worried about going to lectures, since they are rooms with large groups of people. First, if you have to go, **practise good basic hygeine** (wash your hands before and after, cough/sneeze into your elbow or a tissue which you then throw away, don't breathe in random people's faces). Second, **don't get upset with your lecturer**: **it's not their decision** whether lectures take place or not and they are likely also worried about their, your & their family's health (I know I am). You might try getting a group of students together and **asking your lecturer if they would consider online lectures**. I know I would do that if I could (but I'm in a laid back Faculty and have small lecture sizes compared to colleagues). If that's not possible, **ask if your lecturer could remind students about hygeine at the start/end of each lecture.** Keep in mind that [**74 UK universities are currently on strike anyway**](https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/10621/UCU-announces-14-strike-days-at-74-UK-universities-in-February-and-March?fbclid=IwAR3v1GqIYEDb6PDn8FBeLVoZugwmsreDDr7l2r2u8wBEwkhKOeWoTg4SHeI), so your lectures next week may not be taking place at all!\n* **Exams:** Universities are making contingency plans for exams, including **postponement** or even **taking them remotely** (Edit: see comment below by u/FlipDetector). My personal feeling is that everyone is waiting to see how things develop before making any decisions, but rest assured that there are measures in place and those should definitely be communciated to you as soon as a decision is made.\n* **Mitigation measures:** Our university is installing hand sanitizing stations in most buildings and asking students and staff to use these as they leave and enter buildings. Combined with proper coughing/sneezing etiquette (in an elbow or in a tissue and then thrown away) and not breathing in people's faces, this is seen as a good strategy to mitigate transmission.\n* **Conferences and travel:** Right now, I haven't heard any official recommendations for cancelling conferences. Some laboratories have been told to limit all non-essential travel since at least last week.\n* **Self-isolation and halls of residence:** If you live in university-managed accommodation (check this, since a lot of this has been sold off), your university probably has drawn up a plan for students who need to self-isolate which can then be extended to whole flats/blocks, etc. I've no idea what this would involve at other unis, but here our plan includes having designated flats which are currently empty and where ill students could be accommodated and have food and other supplies delivered daily. If you live in privately-owned/-managed halls, I think you should feel empowered to ask what their plan is, if they have one.\n* **Laboratories:** Depending on size and national importance, laboratories may have a designated team of people who will have to go in during a crisis and take care of essential maintenance and upkeep (working on crucial science if told to do so, shutting down experiments, feeding animals, etc.).\n* **International students:** If your visa is running out and you can't return home, the university should help you with this.
