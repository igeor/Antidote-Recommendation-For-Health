My MIL works in a very public facing role and would certainly not stop this, she is one of those who \"doesnt listen to experts\". I imagine she is fairly unaware of coronavirus despite being in a job where she really needs to be!\n\nMy husband is totally on board with prepping - we have plenty to last months. He is being very careful at work, though is the only one doing so of the many thousand who work there apparently. I'm still on maternity leave for now but I work in a hospital in a patient facing role with a vulnerable population.\n\nBut he is considering going to live with his parents for a while once things kick off so that he can still see his other 2 children and not put me and the little ones at risk, and also help his parents. And just accept that he will get it and they will all get it and that he wont see us for a while. But I also think he thinks it will never come to this and that I'm mental. You can see him struggling with everyone on one side saying \"just flu\" and the reality on the other, he doesnt want to deal basically and I think he thinks it'll be easier with his mum where he can pretend it's fine. But equally he's trying to work out how to secure the house from looters!\n\nI'm sad and frightened and want to be selfish and ask him to stay. Being so alone for potentially months is such a scary thought. I cant even believe any of these things are considerations. It's all insane.
